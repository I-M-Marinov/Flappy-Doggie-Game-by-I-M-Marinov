# Flappy-Doggy-Game-by-I-M-Marinov

## Description:

- Simple Windows Forms game
  
## Technology stack:
- C#
- .NET Core
- Photoshop CS6 ( some of the images ) + unsplash.com
- Figma
- Little Dinosour Font ( https://www.1001fonts.com/little-dinosaur-font.html )
  

## Features
- A C# Game that resembles the famous "Flappy Bird" game that took over the world in 2013 ( originally created by Dong Nguyen ).
- Instead of a Bird, your playable character is a Corgi dog ( inspired by my own corgi doggy Joey ) 
- Use the arrows to avoid the obstacles ( pipes ) and gain a point for every pipe/obstacle that you miss.

## Last Updates: 

- Retry Button added, so the user can restart the game without restarting the application
- Game speed increases every 20 points ( 20 pipes evaded )
- Added a label that helps the player see which is the current level of speed in-game
- The pipes disappear when the game is over, so the player has a more clear view of the butoons and the high score input field.
- Added High Scores that output on a txt file ( currently in the game folder ).
